# Result: Group 1: Showed a significant decrease in the average number of text messages sent, dropping from approximately 66 at Baseline to about 53 at the six-month mark. The error bars (which represent standard error) do not overlap, suggesting this change is statistically significant.
# Group 2: Showed only a slight decrease in average text messages, from approximately 67 at Baseline to 62 at six months. The error bars for these two time points overlap, suggesting this small drop is likely not statistically significant.In summary, while both groups started with a similar average, Group 1 experienced a much larger and more statistically significant reduction in text messages after six months compared to Group 2.
