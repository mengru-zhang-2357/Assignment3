# The purpose of this code is for group assignment 3 Visualization #2: Creates
# stratified bar charts of text messages Group and Time

#Result: Group 1: Showed a significant decrease in the average number of text
#messages sent, dropping from approximately 66 at Baseline to about 53 at the
#six-month mark. The error bars (which represent standard error) do not overlap,
#suggesting this change is statistically significant.Group 2: Showed only a
#slight decrease in average text messages, from approximately 67 at Baseline to
#62 at six months. The error bars for these two time points overlap, suggesting
#this small drop is likely not statistically significant.In summary, while both
#groups started with a similar average, Group 1 experienced a much larger and
#more statistically significant reduction in text messages after six months
#compared to Group 2.
