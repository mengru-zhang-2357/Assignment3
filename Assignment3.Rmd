# There are 25 data points in each group at each timepoint.
# Group 1 and Group 2 showed similar means and medians around 65, with standard deviation of 10.7-10.8. The minimum values of both groups are 46-47, and maximum are 85 and 89, respectively. Overall, the two groups display similar summary statistics at the Baseline timepoint. At the Six Months timepoint, the statistics are quite different. Group 1 has a mean of 53 and median of 58, while Group 2 has a mean of 61.8 and median of 62. 
# For Group 1,  the standard deviation increased to 16.3, while for Group 2, the standard deviation slightly decreased to 9.41. Group 1 sees more extreme values on the downside, with a minimum of 9 text messages. Both groups saw maximum number of text messages near 80.

# Group 1 showed a significant decrease in the average number of text messages sent, dropping from approximately 65 at Baseline to about 53 at the six-month mark. The error bars (which represent 95% CI) do not overlap, suggesting this change is statistically significant.
# Group 2 showed only a slight decrease in average text messages, from approximately 66 at Baseline to 62 at six months. The error bars for these two time points overlap, suggesting this small drop is likely not statistically significant.


# In summary, while both groups started with a similar average, Group 1 experienced a much larger and more statistically significant reduction in text messages after six months compared to Group 2.
